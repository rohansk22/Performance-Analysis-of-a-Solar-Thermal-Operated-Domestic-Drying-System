# Performance-Analysis-of-a-Solar-Thermal-Operated-Domestic-Drying-System
Predicted the drying rate of different leaves so as to optimize the performance of a drying system <br>

<br> The drying system is basically a solar dryer comprising of a black tray mounted on an aluminium frame and enclosed within a glass cover. This glass tray induces a greenhouse effect that effectively dries the leaves. <br>
<br> As part of my final year project, my team ( Prerak, Shravan, Shikhar and I ) undertook a project to characterize the working of this dryer. <br>
<br> The idea was to predict how quickly it would dry leaves based on the weather conditions of the place. We conducted this project in Bangalore, India. <br>

<br> We tested 2 use cases: Open drying V/s Closed Drying <br>

<br> We compared the performance of the dryer in these two conditions. <br>

<br> How? well, we weighed the leaves at each hour in which the sun was up. As the leaves dried, they lost the moisture content within them and eventually lost weight too. <br>

<br> We calculated the moisture content based on a formula and calculated the drying rate. <br>

<br> We then modelled the drying rate using 5 different mathematical models: <br>
1. Lewis/Newton <br>
2. Henderson and Pabis <br>
3. Logarithmic <br>
4. Page <br>
5. Wang and Singh <br>


  <br> I used curve fitting in MATLAB to fit the data into these models. The model with the best RMSE, R-squared and Chi-Squared values was selected to characterize the model.<br>
